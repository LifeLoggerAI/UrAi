# URAI Launch Execution Plan

## 1. Master Execution Sheet & Issues
- Generate and structure an interactive Google Sheets/Excel launch tracker.
- Draft master GitHub issues for each launch area (assets, AI, backend, QA, compliance, orchestration, enhancements).
- Populate tracker with task IDs, sections, priorities, status checkboxes, file paths, dependencies.

## 2. Sheet Features
- Add conditional formatting (priority, status).
- Enable interactive checkboxes for “Verified” column.
- Add hyperlinks for file paths/functions.
- Enable filters, sorting by priority/status/section.
- Add section-wise progress bars and formulas.
- Add dynamic dashboard tab: overall completion %, section completion %, high-priority tasks, top risks, next actions.

## 3. Dashboard Enhancements
- Color-coded alerts for section progress (red/yellow/green).
- Top 3 Priority Risks (unverified high-priority tasks) highlighted.
- Next 5 Critical Actions (live “do this next” list).
- Completion heatmap per section (mini-bar chart visual).
- Executive summary of lagging/risky areas.
