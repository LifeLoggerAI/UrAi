# URAI v6â€“v10 Delivery Tracker

This tracker captures high-level acceptance checkpoints for milestones v6 through v10 and maps the incremental hardening work as it lands. Update the status columns as deliverables progress.

| Firestore rules unit coverage | ðŸ§­ | Pending emulator harness and assertions. |
| Auth reliability improvements | ðŸ§­ | Session persistence and retry logic not yet addressed. |
| Sentry release health | ðŸ§­ | Requires DSN + CI hook. |

| Narrator SSML templates and fallbacks | ðŸ§­ | No runtime changes landed yet. |
| Cognitive Mirror scoring | ðŸ§­ | Awaiting data model + scoring utilities. |
| Timeline playback polish | ðŸ§­ | Rendering and comparison modes outstanding. |
| Export surface (PNG/PDF/SRT) | ðŸ§­ | Export pipeline not started. |

## v8 â€” Visual Polish, Pro Tier, Performance, Accessibility

| Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Visual/loading experience coherence | ðŸš§ | Shared `RouteState` surfaces consistent motionless fallback; additional Rive/Lottie work outstanding. |
| Paywall & Stripe integration | ðŸ§­ | Checkout flow and entitlements not implemented. |
| Performance budgets (P95 â‰¤ 2.0s) | ðŸ§­ | Needs bundle analysis and caching strategy. |
| Accessibility audit | ðŸ§­ | Keyboard/focus/inclusive motion still pending. |

## v9 â€” Scale, Data, Insights, Marketplace Prep

| Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BigQuery export automation | ðŸ§­ | Export job + dashboards not yet built. |
| Emotion Forecast API | ðŸ§­ | Service scaffolding not present. |
| Social/relationship layer | ðŸ§­ | Feature design + privacy gating outstanding. |
| Reliability SLO dashboards | ðŸ§­ | Observability backlog to be scheduled. |

## v10 â€” WOW Demo, Internationalisation, Launch

| Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WOW demo deterministic data | ðŸ§­ | Demo seeding pending. |
| i18n starter packs | ðŸ§­ | Locale plumbing not yet implemented. |
| Growth stack (email/referral/UTM) | ðŸ§­ | Requires analytics pipeline. |
| Compliance package | ðŸ§­ | Legal + data policy tasks outstanding. |

## Operational Follow-ups

- Adopt the telemetry helpers in feature segments (e.g., `/life-map`, `/narrator`) to capture route-level context.
- Extend `RouteState` for feature-specific empty/error states so teams can opt into consistent copy and styling.
- Wire telemetry events to real analytics sinks (Sentry, BigQuery, custom log collectors) once credentials are available.
- Pair the new surfaces with Playwright smoke coverage once the E2E harness is stable.
