- Create detailed feature lists and acceptance criteria
- Prioritize features (MVP, V1, V2, stretch goals)
- Draw user flows, wireframes, mockups
- Plan milestones, sprints, deadlines

---

## **3. Architecture & Design**
- Choose tech stack (React, Node.js, Python/Flask, etc.)
- System architecture (monolith/microservices, DB, hosting)
- API contract design (OpenAPI/Swagger)

- User guides (how-to, troubleshooting, scenarios)
- Developer guides (setup, contribution)
- Architecture diagrams

---

## **7. Deployment & Release**
- Cloud deployment (AWS, Azure, GCP, Vercel, etc.)
- Staging & production environments
- Monitoring, logging, alerting
- Rollback and release notes

---

## **8. Feedback & Iteration**
