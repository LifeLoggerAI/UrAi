Based on this, generate a title, a short description, and a specific suggestion.

For the 'head' zone (thoughts, dreams), suggest something related to clarifying thoughts or exploring symbols.
For the 'torso' zone (emotions, memories), suggest something related to processing a feeling or revisiting a memory kindly.
For the 'limbs' zone (actions, social), suggest a small action related to the body or social connection.
For the 'aura' zone (overall mood), suggest a general mindfulness or gratitude exercise.`,
