// Example 1: Simple birthday party
const birthdayPartyExample: GenerateStoryboardInput = {
  eventDescription: `Sarah's 30th birthday party at Central Park. It was a sunny Saturday afternoon in June. About 15 friends gathered near the boathouse for a picnic celebration. Sarah is a tall woman with curly red hair, green eyes, and a bright smile. She was wearing a flowing blue sundress and sandals. Her best friend Mike brought his guitar and played some acoustic songs. There was a decorated cake, balloons, and everyone was laughing and enjoying the beautiful weather. The party lasted about 3 hours with lots of photos taken by the lake.`
