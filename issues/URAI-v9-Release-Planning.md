# URAI v9: Emotional Time Warp Player

## Overview
Implementation of the Emotional Time Warp Player - an interactive timeline system that allows users to navigate through their emotional and life event history with temporal navigation controls and symbolic visualization.

## Module Specification
| Module | Name | Symbolic Purpose | Key Features |
|---|---|---|---|
| v9 | Emotional Time Warp Player | Symbolic playback | Interactive timeline of moods & events |

## Description
The Emotional Time Warp Player provides users with the ability to traverse their emotional timeline interactively, offering temporal controls to fast-forward, rewind, and zoom into specific periods of their life journey. This module transforms captured life data into a navigable symbolic experience.

## Core Features
