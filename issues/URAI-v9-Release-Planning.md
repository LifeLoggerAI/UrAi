Parent Issue

Parent: #68 - URAI v9 & v10 Release Planning

Description

This issue tracks the v9 release scope for the Emotional Time Warp Player and its sprint artifacts. It is a child of the v9 & v10 release planning parent and coordinates both planning and implementation details.

The Emotional Time Warp Player provides users with the ability to traverse their emotional timeline interactively—play, pause, fast-forward, rewind, and zoom into specific periods of their life journey. It transforms captured life data into a navigable symbolic experience.

Tasks (Release Planning)

 Define release timeline (coordinated with parent issue #68)

 Identify sprint goals (documented in parent issue #68)

 Review sprint artifacts

 Coordinate with v10 release planning

 Track progress on v9 subtasks (#69–#73)
