# Issue #69: v9 Emotional Time Warp Player - Core Implementation

## Parent Issue
- **Parent**: [#68 - URAI v9 & v10 Release Planning](68-urai-v9-v10-release-planning-parent.md)

## Description
Implement the core infrastructure for the Emotional Time Warp Player module (v9), which provides symbolic playback functionality for interactive timelines of moods and events.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create base EmoTimeWarpPlayer class with symbolic playback interface
- [ ] Implement data structure for storing mood/event timeline points
- [ ] Develop symbolic navigation system for timeline traversal
- [ ] Create playback engine for mood state reconstruction
- [ ] Implement time-based indexing for efficient event retrieval
- [ ] Add symbolic markers for key emotional transitions

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] Design timeline data model with timestamp, mood, and symbolic metadata
- [ ] Implement caching system for smooth playback performance
- [ ] Create API endpoints for timeline data access
- [ ] Develop symbolic playback algorithms
- [ ] Add error handling for missing or corrupted timeline data

## Dependencies
- Requires v1-v6 core data capture and mood forecast systems
- Integrates with existing symbolic tagging from v2
- Uses GPS contextual data from v4

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for core playback functionality
- [ ] Integration tests with mood forecast API (v6)
- [ ] Performance tests for large timeline datasets
- [ ] Edge case testing for incomplete data
