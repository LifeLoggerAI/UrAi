# Issue #74: v10 Insight Journal Thread View - Core Implementation

## Parent Issue
- **Parent**: [#68 - URAI v9 & v10 Release Planning](68-urai-v9-v10-release-planning-parent.md)

## Description
Implement the core infrastructure for the Insight Journal Thread View module (v10), which provides pattern grouping functionality to organize reflections by symbolic theme.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create base InsightJournalThreadView class with pattern organization interface
- [ ] Implement data structure for storing insight threads and symbolic themes
- [ ] Develop thread grouping algorithms based on symbolic patterns
- [ ] Create insight reflection storage and retrieval system
- [ ] Implement theme detection and categorization engine
- [ ] Add symbolic thread linking and relationship mapping

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] Design insight data model with content, theme, and symbolic metadata
- [ ] Implement efficient search and filtering system for threads
- [ ] Create API endpoints for insight journal data access
- [ ] Develop symbolic pattern matching algorithms
- [ ] Add version control for insight evolution tracking
- [ ] Implement thread merging and splitting capabilities

## Data Architecture
- [ ] Insight entry structure with timestamps and symbolic tags
- [ ] Thread hierarchy system for nested insight organization
- [ ] Theme taxonomy for consistent symbolic categorization
- [ ] Cross-referencing system between related insights
- [ ] Symbolic metadata schema for pattern recognition
- [ ] Privacy-preserving insight aggregation framework

## Core Features
- [ ] Automatic insight categorization based on symbolic content
- [ ] Manual thread organization with drag-and-drop interface
- [ ] Insight search functionality with symbolic filtering
- [ ] Thread timeline view showing insight evolution
- [ ] Cross-thread insight correlation detection
- [ ] Symbolic insight tagging system

## Dependencies
- Integrates with v2 symbolic tagging system
- Uses v3 pattern recognition capabilities
- Connects to v9 emotional timeline for context
- Prepares for v13 companion memory integration

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for core thread organization functionality
- [ ] Integration tests with symbolic tagging system
- [ ] Performance tests for large insight datasets
- [ ] Edge case testing for malformed or incomplete insights

## Labels
- development
- core-implementation
- v10-module
- priority: high

## Definition of Done
