## Development Coordination

### Shared Dependencies
Both v9 and v10 rely on several common systems that should be prioritized:

#### Critical Shared Components
- **v2: Audio Transcription & Symbol Tagging** - Source data for both modules
- **v6: Mood Forecast API** - Emotional analysis foundation
- **v11: Global Pattern AI** - Pattern recognition infrastructure
- **v13: Trainable Companion Memory** - AI insights and guidance
- **v40: Multi-Asset Export Suite** - Export functionality for both modules

#### Integration Points
- **Timeline-Thread Connection**: v10 should reference and link to specific timeline periods in v9
- **Shared Symbolic Language**: Both modules use symbolic representations that must be consistent
- **Common Data Models**: Emotional states, events, and insights need unified data structures
- **Privacy Controls**: Consistent privacy and sharing controls across both modules

### Development Sequencing Strategy

#### Option A: Sequential Development (Recommended)
**Phase 1: v9 Development (Weeks 1-10)**
- Focus on timeline infrastructure and core functionality

**Phase 2: v10 Development (Weeks 8-20)**
- Start v10 development in week 8 (overlap with v9 testing)
- Leverage established data models from v9
- Build on symbolic standards from v9
- Full integration testing with v9 in final weeks

**Benefits:**
- v9 establishes foundation patterns for v10
- Reduces integration complexity
- Allows learning from v9 implementation to improve v10
- Lower risk of conflicting changes

#### Option B: Parallel Development (Higher Risk)
**Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)**
- Shared infrastructure development
- Common data models and APIs
- Symbolic representation standards
- Integration architecture planning

**Phase 2: Core Development (Weeks 4-16)**
- Parallel development of v9 and v10 core features
- Regular integration checkpoints
- Shared component coordination

**Benefits:**
- Faster overall delivery
- More efficient resource utilization
- Earlier feature availability

**Risks:**
- Integration complexity
- Potential rework from conflicts
- Coordination overhead

### Resource Allocation

#### Team Structure Recommendation
- **Shared Infrastructure Team**: 2 developers (data models, APIs, symbolic standards)

- **v10 Team**: 4 developers (frontend 2, backend 1, AI specialist 1)
- **QA Team**: 2 testers (focus on integration and user experience)
- **Design Team**: 1 designer (consistent UX across both modules)

#### Skills Required
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Canvas/WebGL, Performance optimization
- **Backend**: Node.js, Database optimization, API design
- **AI/ML**: NLP, clustering algorithms, pattern recognition
- **QA**: Integration testing, performance testing, user experience validation
