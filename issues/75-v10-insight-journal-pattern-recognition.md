# Issue #75: v10 Insight Journal Thread View - Pattern Recognition

## Parent Issue
- **Parent**: [#68 - URAI v9 & v10 Release Planning](68-urai-v9-v10-release-planning-parent.md)

## Description
Develop advanced pattern recognition capabilities for the Insight Journal Thread View, enabling automatic detection and categorization of symbolic themes across user reflections and insights.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement AI-powered symbolic pattern detection algorithms
- [ ] Create theme classification system with symbolic categories
- [ ] Develop insight similarity matching engine
- [ ] Build automatic thread suggestion system
- [ ] Implement recurring pattern identification
- [ ] Create symbolic motif tracking across time periods

## Pattern Recognition Features
- [ ] Natural language processing for insight content analysis
- [ ] Symbolic theme extraction from text and metadata
- [ ] Emotional pattern correlation with insight content
- [ ] Temporal pattern recognition for cyclical insights
- [ ] Cross-reference pattern detection between different insights
- [ ] Anomaly detection for unusual insight patterns

## AI & Machine Learning
- [ ] Train symbolic theme classification models
- [ ] Implement similarity scoring algorithms for insights
- [ ] Develop clustering algorithms for thread organization
- [ ] Create predictive models for future insight themes
- [ ] Build recommendation engine for related insights
- [ ] Implement adaptive learning from user feedback

## Symbolic Theme Categories
- [ ] Define comprehensive symbolic theme taxonomy
- [ ] Implement hierarchical theme organization
- [ ] Create theme confidence scoring system
- [ ] Develop theme evolution tracking
- [ ] Build theme relationship mapping
- [ ] Add custom theme creation capabilities

## Advanced Features
- [ ] Multi-language insight processing
- [ ] Symbolic emoji and icon pattern recognition
- [ ] Cross-platform insight synchronization
- [ ] Collaborative theme detection across users (anonymized)
- [ ] Seasonal and temporal theme pattern analysis
- [ ] Integration with external reflection platforms

## Dependencies
