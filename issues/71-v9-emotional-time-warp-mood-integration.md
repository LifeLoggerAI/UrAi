# Issue #71: v9 Emotional Time Warp Player - Mood Integration

## Parent Issue
- **Parent**: [#68 - URAI v9 & v10 Release Planning](68-urai-v9-v10-release-planning-parent.md)

## Description
Integrate the Emotional Time Warp Player with the mood forecasting system and existing mood data to create a cohesive emotional playback experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Connect timeline player with mood forecast API (v6)
- [ ] Implement mood state reconstruction from historical data
- [ ] Create symbolic mood transition detection algorithms
- [ ] Develop mood pattern recognition for timeline clustering
- [ ] Integrate ambient mood data from device sensors
- [ ] Implement predictive mood overlay for future timeline segments

## Integration Points
- [ ] Real-time mood data from ongoing capture systems
- [ ] Historical mood patterns from v6 mood forecast API
- [ ] Contextual mood inference from GPS/sensor data (v4)
- [ ] Symbolic mood tags from audio transcription (v2)
- [ ] Ambient tracking mood signals (planned for v38)

## Mood Playback Features
- [ ] Reconstruct emotional states at specific timeline points
- [ ] Smooth mood transitions between timeline segments
- [ ] Symbolic mood representation (colors, patterns, intensity)
- [ ] Mood clustering to identify similar emotional periods
- [ ] Emotional echo detection (recurring mood patterns)

## Data Processing
- [ ] Mood data normalization across different sources
- [ ] Timeline segmentation based on mood changes
- [ ] Symbolic mood encoding for efficient storage/retrieval
- [ ] Mood correlation analysis with life events
- [ ] Privacy-preserving mood data aggregation

## Dependencies
- Requires [#69 - v9 Core Implementation](69-v9-emotional-time-warp-player-core.md)
- Integrates with v6 mood forecast API
- Uses v2 symbolic tagging system
- Connects to v4 GPS contextual inference

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Mood data accuracy validation
- [ ] Integration testing with mood forecast API
- [ ] Performance testing with large mood datasets
- [ ] Edge case testing for missing mood data
- [ ] Privacy compliance testing for mood data handling

## Labels
